# Writing You first App

On this page you will get a quick guide on how to get started with writing your first orbiton app.

## Syntax

Writing Orbiton applications using plain JavaScript can be frustrating. Therefore, the team behind Orbiton created tools that would make it possible for you to write code-using syntax that most developers could easily understand. Depending on your development environment, be it in the browser or using node.js, we got you coverd.

### In plain JavaScript

This method is generally not recommended since its is frastruating to write but if you are commited to use it you can. Most developers use it just for learning purposes in ordr to learn how different tools compile there syntax to Orbiton functions. It can also be useful if your are an experienced devloper or authoring a library.

```js
// Assuming Orbiton is already  declared globaly

const Button = Orbiton.createElement('button', {
  attributes: {
    'class': 'btn-primary',
  },
  children: [
    "Click me"
  ]
  events: {
    'click': ()=>{
      alert('clicked')
    }
  }
})

Orbiton.append(Button, document.getElementById('root'))
```

<Button></Button>
