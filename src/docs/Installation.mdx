# Getting started with Orbiton

This is an overview of the Orbiton JS documentation. It will get you ready to learn Orbiton.

## What is Orbiton

Orbiton JS is a JavaScript library for creating Browser User interfaces. Orbiton was originally developed by [Beingana Jim Junior](https://twitter.com/_jimjunior_) as a rendering engine for his small library for creating video elements. He later decided to separate it from the main package and in order to make it reusable in other projects. That is how it came about.

## Why use Orbiton

Most developers ask themselves why use a new young library like Orbiton yet there are big famous libraries like React and Vue
- __Light Weight__: One of the greatest advantage of Orbiton is that its lightweight compared to other libraries like React. Orbiton is just 6kb - 10kb compared to other libraries that are around 100kb+. This assures you that your app has fast page loads since most of the chunk is from just your own code.
- __Close To Dom__: This is another advantage of Orbiton. Being close to the Dom means that the library will not have to carry out many functions in order to update the Dom making the app feel fast for the user.
- __Reactive__: The library is reactive making you create modern web apps that provide a native feel to the user. This makes it even better for creating Progressive web apps.
- __Modern__: Orbiton JS is among the youngest libraries and so it utilizes modern JavaScript removing legacy code from your apps. Most modern browsers like chrome recommend this.
